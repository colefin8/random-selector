What's New in Random Selector - November 2025

VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS
- Festive confetti animation - Added colorful falling confetti to make the app feel more celebratory and fun!
- Cleaner, more professional layout - Updated the design with better spacing and a more polished look
- Better mobile experience - The app now works great on phones and tablets with improved touch-friendly buttons

NEW FEATURE: MULTIPLE ENTRIES PER PERSON
The biggest update! You can now give some people more chances to win than others.

How it works:
- Simple method: Type names like "John Doe, 3" to give John 3 entries in the drawing
- CSV method: Download our new template file that shows you exactly how to format your data
- Mix and match: You can have some people with 1 entry and others with multiple entries in the same list

Perfect for scenarios like:
- Sales contests where top performers get extra entries
- Raffles where people earned different numbers of tickets
- Any situation where you want weighted random selection

SMARTER WINNER REMOVAL OPTIONS
We've improved what happens after someone wins:

- Remove one entry (default): If John has 3 entries and wins, he'll still have 2 chances left for future draws
- Remove all entries (new option): If John wins, all his entries are removed so he can't win again
- Keep in pool: Winners stay in for every future draw (original behavior)

BETTER PARTICIPANT OVERVIEW
- Entry count table: See exactly how many entries each person has before you start spinning
- Clear summary: Know at a glance how your drawing is set up
- No surprises: Everything is transparent before you begin

QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES
- Download CSV template: Get a perfectly formatted example file to make setup easier
- Better instructions: Clearer examples and help text throughout the app
- Improved error messages: More helpful guidance if something goes wrong
- Faster setup: Streamlined process to get your drawing ready quickly

FULLY BACKWARD COMPATIBLE
Don't worry! All your existing CSV files and workflows will continue to work exactly as before. These new features are completely optional - if you don't use them, the app behaves exactly like it always has.
